apiscout
========

This project aims at simplifying Windows API import recovery on arbitrary memory dumps.

* scout.py should give a good outline on how to work with the library.
* ida_scout.py is a convenience GUI wrapper for use in IDA Pro.

Code should be fully compatible with Python 2 and 3.
There is a blog post describing ApiScout in more detail: http://byte-atlas.blogspot.com/2017/04/apiscout.html.

The idea has previously gone through multiple iterations until reaching this refactored release.
Thanks to Thorsten Jenke and Steffen Enders for their previous endeavours and evaluating a proof-of-concept of this method.
Also thanks to Ero Carrera for pefile and Elias Bachaalany for the IDA Python AskUsingForm template. :)
